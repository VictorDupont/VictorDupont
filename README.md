👋 Hi, I’m @VictorDupont, known as Supernova!  
👀 I love IT, especially development, video games (above all: The Legend of Zelda then Animal Crossing series), Universe, Disney and... Lions.  
🌱 I’m currently at OpenClassrooms improving my coding skills!  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of projects as long as they are related to my passions!  
📫 You want to reach me ? I'm on Discord! Supernova#7777
