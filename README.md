👋 Hi, I’m @VictorDupont, known as Supernova!  
👀 I love IT, especially development and video games! (Above all: The Legend of Zelda and Animal Crossing series)  
🌌 But also: Universe, History, Disney... And lions. 🦁  
🌱 I’m currently at OpenClassrooms improving my coding skills!  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of projects as long as they are related to my passions!  
📫 You want to reach me ? I'm on Discord! Supernova#7777
